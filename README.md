# Movie-Watchlist
Movie watchlist written project in Python GUI which can save and load movies, hold key information about movie such as watch date, review, movie language, etc.

## Getting Started

When you save the watchlist, a *.dat* file will be created in the same folder. 

**Operating the GUI is simple, just type in movie name in entry field and choose which listbox to add it to (out of three). Select a movie and use *delete* button to delete, *ctrl+s* for save, *ctrl+w* to set movie to watched, *ctrl+u* to set movie to unwatched, and *ctrl+i* to get more information about movie.**

A menubar is available at the top if you can't remember the keyboard shortcuts. 

Use freespace click to deselect movies.
